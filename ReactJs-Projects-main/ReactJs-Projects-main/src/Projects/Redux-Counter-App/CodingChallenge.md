### Coding Challenge: React Counter App using Redux Toolkit

#### Estimated Completion Time: 45 minutes

#### Task Overview:

Develop a React Counter application featuring an input field and buttons. This project will demonstrate component-based architecture, responsive design, and adherence to best practices in frontend development.

#### Requirements:

1. Counter Page:

- Layout:
    - Display a real-time current value that updates dynamically based on dispatched actions (Increment, Decrement, Reset).
    - Provide an input field and buttons to allow users to trigger actions (Increment, Decrement) based on the entered value.
- Responsiveness: Ensure the layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.
- Reusability: Design components that can be easily integrated into other parts of the application.
2. Redux Store:

    - Implement a Redux store, reducer, and actions to manage the application's state in a predictable and centralized manner.
3. Styling:

    - Apply CSS or TailwindCSS to create a visually appealing and responsive design.

#### Development Focus:

- Page Layout: Structure the page to effectively integrate all components.
- Component Design: Ensure the Counter components are modular and reusable.
- Data Management: Efficiently handle real-time data updates and synchronization between components.
- User Experience: Prioritize accessibility, responsiveness, and a user-friendly interface.

#### Additional Considerations:

- Feel free to add any extra features or enhancements that you deem appropriate.
